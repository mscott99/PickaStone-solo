### Game Instructions:

This is a game where each players, at the start of each round, chooses a certain 
number of rocks from the ones he posesses(3 at the start) and places them in his 
"hand". He therefore can choose between taking 0, 1, 2 or 3 rocks at the beginning 
of the first round. Then, each player tries to guess at their turn the total amount 
of rocks chosen by all players(including themselves). A player cannot guess a number 
if it has already been guessed previously by another player. If your guess is 
accurate, you win the round, which means that you loose a rock from your stack. At 
the start of the next round, you will have one less rock from which yu can choose 
choose. For example, after winning a total of one round, your possible choices become 
limited to 0, 1 or 2 rocks at the beginning of your round. If you are able to loose 
all your rocks before any other player, you win the game.

When playing in the command line, enter your answers to the displayed questions 
in numbers or in letters, depending on the question, then press enter. This version 
of the game only plays with one human player and as many computers as you wish.

These instructions are also printed at the start of the game if you ask them to be. Good luck!
